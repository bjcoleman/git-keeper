# This is a convenience script to connect to a running server running through
# docker.  The docker daemon will forward a connect to the container's port 22
# when you connect to the docker daemon IP on a mapped port.
#
# This script uses docker commands to look up the ip of the docker deamon and the
# mapped port number.  These are passed to an expect script that connects as
# keeper with the password g1tk33p3r.

./helper.exp `docker-machine ip` `docker port git-keeper-client 22 | cut -c 9-` prof prof
=======
# CLIENT - Use this script to start the git-keeper-client in interactive mode
# This should be run *after* the server is running
# FIXME can we enforce that?

# The following switches ensure we get a static ip and hostname
#
#     -net gknet --ip=172.18.0.15 --hostname=gkclient
#
# This assumes the gknet was created with:
#
#     docker network create --subnet=172.18.0.0/16 gknet
#
# The subnet and ip must match up
# See: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/27937185/assign-static-ip-to-docker-container
# The following switch will put an entry in /etc/hosts for gkserver
#  (which was run with similar )
#
#     --link=gk:gkserver
#
# See: https://docs.docker.com/v1.8/articles/networking/#communication-between-containers
# The following switch mounts a docker volume as the home directory for the
# prof user (this user is built into the container)
#
# -v /Users/coleman/Projects/Docker/git-keeper-client/prof:/home/prof
#
# This home directory contains:
#  .ssh - RSA key that is in authorized_keys on the server.  This allows login
#         without password
#  .config/grader - a configuration file that points to the server
#  .gitconfig - configuration of email and name
#  git-keeper - source code for the program
#  test_assign - a properly configured assignment
#
# The following switches runs the bash shell as the prof user and start us in ~prof
# -- user prof --workdir=/home/prof
#
cwd=$(pwd)
parentdir="$(dirname "$cwd")"
